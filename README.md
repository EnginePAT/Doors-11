# Doors 11 OS
Doors 11 is an operating system built to mimic Windows, whilst still being Unix based. To build Doors, simply install ```i386-elf-gcc``` and ```i386-elf-binutils``` and then run ```make```.  

This will build an .iso image called doors-11-i386-elf.iso which you run by typing ```make run``` or ```qemu-system-i386 -cdrom doors-11-i386-elf.iso```.  
Please ensure that you have qemu installed which you can install here:
